# Enjoy What the Forages Paint

Enjoy the map of berries that stains your palms, the watercolor of moss on stone. 
Foraging is a small cartography of patience: each bend of the trail layers pigments of pine, salt, and soil. 
You learn to read the strokes of wind that sweep birds toward seed, to trust the palette of seasons that hides and reveals. 

Carry a basket as a blank canvas, humble and ready. 
Listen for the hush that tells you fungi are near, for the murmur that the brook leaves on smooth roots. 
Gather slowly, add sparingly, leave the light for someone else to paint their gratitude. 

When you return, do not wash away the story too quickly. 
Hold the twilight-streaked leaves, the smudges of nectar, the graphite lines of twigs. 
Hang them in memory like a gallery of small mercies, and thank the forest for signing your day.
