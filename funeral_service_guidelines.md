# Funeral Service Guidelines (殡葬服务指引)

A concise, practical guide for planning, operating, and evaluating respectful, compliant funeral services that balance ritual needs with safety, transparency, and sustainability.

## Guiding Principles
- **Respect & dignity**: Protect the privacy and cultural wishes of the deceased and family; avoid intrusive sales tactics.
- **Compliance first**: Follow all licensing rules, public health requirements, and documentation standards for transfer, storage, cremation, burial, and ashes handling.
- **Transparency**: Publish clear price lists, itemized service menus, and signed consent forms for every paid item.
- **Safety**: Enforce infection control, lifting ergonomics, fire safety around candles/incense, and secure chemical storage.
- **Sustainability**: Favor low-emission cremation settings, reusable décor, regional flowers, and recyclable/biodegradable urns when possible.

## Facility Zoning & Flow
- **Arrival & verification**: Dedicated receiving bay with CCTV coverage, chain-of-custody logging, and temperature-monitored holding room (2–6 °C).
- **Preparation area**: Clean/aseptic zones with handwashing sinks, negative pressure ventilation, PPE storage, and sharps/medical waste disposal.
- **Viewing & farewell**: Flexible halls (20–200 seats) with dimmable lighting, acoustic control, accessible seating, and respectful signage for photography restrictions.
- **Ceremony circulation**: One-way flow from reception → viewing → farewell → exit/condolence area to avoid cross-traffic.
- **Back-of-house logistics**: Separate corridors/elevators for remains and supplies; lockable rooms for records, ashes, and personal effects.

## Service Process Checklist
1. **Identity confirmation**: Double-tag remains (wrist/ankle + external tag), match to paperwork, and obtain next-of-kin authorization.
2. **Condition assessment**: Note implants, pacemakers, or hazards before refrigeration, embalming, or cremation.
3. **Preparation**: Gentle cleansing, modest dressing, and cosmetic restoration aligned with family requests and faith traditions.
4. **Ceremony setup**: Arrangements for altar, seating plan, multimedia (photo slideshow, live stream), incense/candle safety trays, and fragrance-free zone options.
5. **During service**: On-site attendant to manage timing, music cues, ventilation, and emergency equipment (AED, extinguishers).
6. **Post-service handling**: Secure ashes transfer with sealed container, signed release form, and storage log if temporarily retained.

## Cultural & Ritual Sensitivity
- Provide customizable altars (neutral, Buddhist, Taoist, Christian, secular) and unobtrusive floral options.
- Offer bilingual/officiant support; ensure ritual items (joss paper, incense) are fire-managed and ventilated.
- Respect mourning attire norms; keep spare black/white armbands and condolence books on hand.
- Set quiet hours and signage to minimize disruption to neighboring services.

## Environmental & Emissions Controls
- Maintain cremator temperature and emission filters per manufacturer; log PM/NOx readings if regulations require.
- Offer greener options: lower-resin coffins, shrouds, or biodegradable urns; encourage flower donation or composting.
- Manage wastewater from preparation areas via grease traps and proper disinfection protocols.

## Digital & Data Practices
- Online scheduling with time buffers between services; SMS/WeChat notifications for milestones (arrival, viewing start, ashes ready).
- Chain-of-custody recorded in a secure system with dual confirmation for each handoff.
- Privacy: limit livestream access, watermark recordings, and purge data per retention policy.

## Staffing & Training
- Annual training on infection control, grief communication, disability inclusion, and safe handling of remains.
- Shift planning to ensure two-person lifts for heavy transfers and rotation to reduce fatigue.
- Clear roles: coordinator, preparation specialist, ceremony attendant, emissions technician, and compliance officer.

## Metrics & Continuous Improvement
- Family satisfaction surveys within 72 hours; track response themes and corrective actions.
- Operational KPIs: on-time service start rate, incident-free ceremonies, emissions compliance pass rate, and average resolution time for complaints.
- Quarterly drills for fire/evacuation and medical emergencies; document outcomes and retraining.

## Public Communication & Community Role
- Publish transparent pricing and service scope on-site and online; keep sample contracts visible.
- Offer grief-support resource list (counseling hotlines, community groups) and discreet consultation space.
- Engage with local communities on environmental impact, parking/traffic coordination, and respectful festival scheduling.
