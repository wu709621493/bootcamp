# Molestimate experience inertia

Molestimate is a thought experiment for tracking how experiences accumulate momentum, as if they possess their own inertia. It frames memory, habit, and culture as vectors that resist sudden redirection, requiring steady force to change. Rather than treating experiences as isolated events, the model assumes each new impression adheres to prior trajectories, accelerating or damping them based on alignment.

## Core ingredients
- **Inertial mass of habit:** Repeated routines gain weight; the longer a behavior persists, the more energy is needed to deviate from it.
- **Viscosity of context:** Environments can be sticky or fluid. Supportive contexts lower friction for change, while brittle contexts snap back to their previous state.
- **Impulse events:** Crises, celebrations, and serendipitous meetings provide sudden impulses that can overcome habit mass if the impulse is large enough and well-timed.

## Estimation sketch
1. Map recent experiences on a timeline and classify them by alignment (reinforcing) or opposition (countering) to the current trajectory.
2. Assign each experience a provisional mass based on duration and repetition, then compute net momentum by summing aligned vectors.
3. Evaluate upcoming impulses (projects, moves, conversations) against this momentum to estimate how much force is required to pivot.

## Applied reflection
Working with molestimate means designing interventions that respect inertia rather than ignoring it. Change campaigns should start with low-friction nudges that gradually reorient habits, only deploying high-intensity impulses when the system is already warmed up. In personal development, the practice becomes a gentle audit: where is inertia serving growth, and where is it quietly steering life away from chosen aims?
