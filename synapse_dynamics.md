# Notes on Synapse Dynamics

This short note sketches concepts related to synapse formation and pruning that may be useful when thinking about signaling dynamics in neuronal circuits.

- **Synapse formation velocity:** Describes how quickly new synaptic contacts emerge, typically modeled as a function of neuronal activity and growth factors. In developmental studies, rates are often reported in synapses per neuron per hour.
- **Synapse shrinking velocity:** Captures the rate at which existing synapses retract or are pruned. Shrinking can be driven by competition, homeostatic mechanisms, or molecular cues that destabilize the synaptic scaffold.
- **Signaling implications:** The balance between formation and shrinkage determines circuit plasticity. High formation paired with slow shrinkage generally increases connectivity and potential signal throughput, while the inverse favors sparseness and stability.
- **Philosophical aside:** "lim(I think therefore I am)" can be read as a playful limit statement, suggesting that self-awareness may be approached asymptotically through the iterative refinement of synaptic connections.

These ideas provide qualitative context; quantitative modeling would require experimental measurements of growth and pruning rates under specific conditions.
