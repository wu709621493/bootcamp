# Fair Electricity for China: Access, Affordability, and Equity

## Guiding Principles
- **Universal service:** Guarantee baseline electricity access for every household and small business with minimum reliable supply standards (e.g., >99% annual availability, voltage within ±5%).
- **Affordability first:** Cap essential lifeline consumption at a low, stable tariff; expand income-based subsidies using digital verification tied to social security and rural cooperative records.
- **Equity across regions:** Adjust transfers so that under-resourced provinces receive predictable support for maintenance and grid upgrades, minimizing rural-urban reliability gaps.
- **Just transition:** Ensure communities affected by fossil fuel phase-down receive targeted investment, retraining, and local clean-energy projects.

## Pricing and Subsidy Design
- **Tiered tariffs:**
  - Lifeline tier (e.g., first 30–50 kWh/month per household) at heavily discounted rates, funded by a national solidarity surcharge and carbon revenues.
  - Progressive tiers above basic needs to curb waste and fund equity programs.
- **Targeted support:** Use means-tested e-vouchers delivered through utility apps/WeChat mini-programs; auto-adjust benefits when incomes or household size change.
- **Rural microgrids:** Allow community-owned solar+storage microgrids with regulated tariffs, backed by low-interest loans and performance-based grants for uptime and affordability.
- **Consumer protection:** Simplify bills, enforce plain-language disclosure of fees, and publish provincial comparison dashboards.

## Reliability and Quality of Service
- **Minimum service standards:** Set outage frequency/duration caps (SAIFI/SAIDI) with penalties for utilities that miss targets and incentives for overperformance in underserved areas.
- **Resilience upgrades:** Harden distribution networks in typhoon- and flood-prone regions (undergrounding, sectionalizing switches, rapid fault isolation) and prioritize backup power for clinics, schools, and telecom sites.
- **Voltage quality programs:** Deploy smart transformers, voltage/VAR optimization, and advanced metering to reduce flicker and losses, especially on long rural feeders.

## Community Participation and Transparency
- **Participatory planning:** Require utilities to host annual local hearings and publish three-year equity action plans with budgets, timelines, and measurable targets.
- **Open data:** Release anonymized feeder-level reliability and pricing data; allow third parties to build alert tools that notify customers of planned outages or tariff changes.
- **Grievance redress:** Establish independent provincial ombuds offices with binding resolution authority and tracked response times; integrate complaint channels into billing apps.

## Investment and Financing
- **Equity fund:** Create a national electricity equity fund capitalized by carbon pricing revenue, central budget allocations, and green bonds; allocate using transparent formulas based on outage history, poverty rates, and load growth.
- **Local capacity building:** Finance training for distribution engineers, microgrid operators, and consumer advocates; pair under-resourced utilities with mentor utilities for technology transfer.
- **Performance-based grants:** Link grants to verified improvements in reliability metrics, lifeline tariff enrollment, and customer satisfaction scores.

## Fair Transition and Workforce
- **Retraining pathways:** Offer stipends and certification programs for coal-plant and mine workers to shift into grid modernization, renewable O&M, and energy-efficiency services.
- **Community benefits agreements:** Require new renewable and transmission projects to include local hiring targets, land-lease transparency, and revenue-sharing for affected villages.
- **Health and safety:** Strengthen occupational safety standards for lineworkers and enforce heat-stress protocols amid rising temperatures.

## Metrics and Accountability
- **Key indicators:** Lifeline enrollment rate, average household electricity burden (% of income), SAIDI/SAIFI by province, voltage compliance rates, and grievance resolution times.
- **Annual equity scorecard:** Publish a national scorecard comparing provinces on affordability, reliability, and transition support; tie executive compensation at state-owned utilities to improvements.
- **Independent evaluation:** Commission third-party audits every two years to validate subsidy targeting, reliability metrics, and fund allocation.
