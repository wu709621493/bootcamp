# C Bonds I to O

C is the hinge in the phrase, a curved arm that clasps **I** and **O** into one orbit. Its open crescent accepts both shapes: one a narrow pillar, the other a full loop. In chemistry, a covalent bond shares electrons; here, **C** shares the arc that lets **I** slide toward **O** without losing its upright clarity.

- **C as conduit:** The curve leads **I** out of isolation, turning a solitary stroke into a pathway that ends in a circle.
- **Orbit and intention:** **O** is a completed loop, a sign of return. **C** offers a near-closed form, inviting **I** to complete the cycle but keeping a deliberate gap.
- **Sound and flow:** Said aloud, the sequence “see–eye–oh” is a breath that widens. The consonant opens, the vowel spikes, and the last vowel rounds off, all mediated by the initial curve.

To bond **I** to **O** through **C** is to remind straight lines that they can bend and still hold their identity. The curve does not erase the pillar; it teaches it to travel in an arc and to end in a ring.
