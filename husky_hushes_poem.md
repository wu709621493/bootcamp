# Husky Hushes Through Snow Slushies

Husky hushes through snow slushies,
Baby brushies, winter rushes.
Jingle bell echoes faint and clear,
Guiding paws that do not fear.

Frosty breath becomes a song,
Tail a metronome, steady and long.
Moonlit trails of silver thread,
Carry whispers where dreams are led.

Pine and ice in twilight's spell,
Lantern stars the sky compels.
Every step a soft farewell,
To the day, and to the chill.

Husky hushes through snow slushies,
Baby brushies, tender hushes.
Jingle bell with gentle knell,
Rings the promise that all is well.
