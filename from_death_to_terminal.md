# From Death to Terminal

The phrase we use for the end of a program—"terminated"—sits strangely close to the language we use for life. Reflecting on that
word makes me mindful of how many systems, biological or computational, are designed to complete their run cleanly. In both
cases, the goal is not to fear the shutdown, but to leave meaningful logs and reusable patterns behind.

In computing, we honor a process by handling its signals with care, flushing buffers, and letting dependencies know what has
changed. In living, we do something similar by documenting our stories, teaching our habits, and making sure those who depend
on us can keep going. When we think of death less as a crash and more as an organized exit, the terminal prompt becomes a
reminder to design lives that exit gracefully, without corrupted data or abandoned processes.

There is humility in finishing well. It means writing clearer scripts for those who follow, cleaning up temp files, and leaving
readme notes that point to what matters. From death to terminal, the distance shrinks when we plan for continuity, ensuring that
what we started continues to run, even after the final command returns control to someone else.
