# National Mandate for Drinkable Tap Water in China

## Goal and Timeline
- Guarantee drinkable tap water that meets or exceeds WHO drinking-water guidelines across all provinces by 2030, with milestones in 2025 (urban compliance) and 2028 (county-level compliance).
- Integrate the mandate into Five-Year Plan water-security targets and provincial ecological-civilization KPIs.

## Standards and Regulation
- Adopt unified national standards aligned with WHO limits for microbial, chemical, and radiological parameters; publish a crosswalk with existing GB standards for clarity.
- Require utilities to maintain residual disinfectant at household taps and to publish monthly water-quality dashboards by district.
- Mandate full traceability from source to tap (digital chain-of-custody for sampling, lab results, and corrective actions) via the national water data platform.

## Infrastructure Upgrade Program
- Prioritize renovation of aging distribution networks to prevent leakage and secondary contamination; set annual non-revenue water reduction targets (e.g., <10% in Tier 1 cities by 2026, <15% nationwide by 2030).
- Expand advanced treatment (ozone + activated carbon + membrane filtration) at plants drawing from high-risk surface sources; add on-site emergency disinfection for extreme events.
- Require household service-line material inventories and phased replacement of lead-containing components; offer subsidies for vulnerable communities.
- Increase rural centralized supply coverage; where decentralized systems remain, deploy modular treatment units with remote monitoring.

## Monitoring, Transparency, and Public Reporting
- National platform aggregates real-time SCADA data, lab results, and sensor alerts; open public access to daily summary indicators and incident logs.
- Mandate independent third-party audits of treatment plants annually and surprise inspections quarterly for utilities with prior violations.
- Establish a consumer-facing hotline and mini-program for taste/odor/pressure complaints; enforce 24-hour investigation and 72-hour resolution targets.

## Enforcement and Accountability
- Link utility leadership performance evaluations and bonuses to compliance rates and customer satisfaction metrics.
- Implement escalating penalties: fines for exceedances, binding rectification orders, and potential management replacement for repeated violations.
- Require provincial governments to publish annual "safe tap water" scorecards, ranking cities/counties and highlighting corrective investments.

## Financing and Incentives
- Blend central/provincial grants, low-interest policy-bank loans, and green bonds to fund capital upgrades; prioritize projects that also reduce energy intensity per cubic meter treated.
- Offer performance-based subsidies for utilities that achieve continuous compliance and reduce leakage ahead of targets.
- Encourage public-private partnerships for technology deployment (smart meters, real-time sensors, AI-based leak detection) with data-sharing requirements.

## Risk Management and Resilience
- Require climate-robust source protection plans (flood, drought, and contamination scenarios) with pre-positioned mobile treatment capacity.
- Integrate emergency response protocols across water, health, and environmental agencies; conduct annual joint drills.
- Maintain diversified source portfolios (surface, groundwater, and inter-basin transfers) to reduce single-point failures.

## Public Health and Communication
- Coordinate with CDCs to track waterborne illness trends and rapidly correlate with supply incidents.
- Launch public education on tap water safety, conservation, and reporting channels; provide clear guidance during advisories or flush recommendations.
- Certify schools, hospitals, and elder-care facilities annually and publish results; require immediate remediation for any non-compliance.
