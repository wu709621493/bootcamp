# Love Is A

Love is a seamstress that stitches together mismatched days into a single quilt of meaning.
It is a lens that sharpens the edges of the world without erasing its softness.
It is a compass that spins when we fear we are lost, reminding us that direction comes from devotion rather than distance.
It is a hearth that accepts damp kindling and still coaxes a flame from patience.
It is a verb that insists on being conjugated in future tense, even when the past feels heavier.
It is a mirror that shows what we overlook: the tenderness we offer is also the tenderness we need.
It is a promise that the ordinary can be luminous when tended with care.
