# Anger as Movement

Anger often arrives like a physical surge, a collection of movements that signal the body is ready to defend boundaries or correct a perceived wrong. Understanding these signs helps separate the raw impulse from the choices we make next, allowing space to respond rather than simply react.

## Key Points
- **Surge of energy:** Elevated heart rate and muscle tension show the body's preparation for action.
- **Directional focus:** Attention narrows onto the source of frustration, affirming a need to address it.
- **Affirmation of self:** The urge to speak or act asserts personal values and boundaries, reminding us why the emotion matters.
- **Channeling the movement:** Pausing to notice the bodily cues can redirect anger into constructive action—setting limits, communicating clearly, or seeking resolution.

By treating anger as a pattern of movements that signal self-affirmation, we gain a practical handle on the emotion and can steer it toward outcomes that align with our intentions.
