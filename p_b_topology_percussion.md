# Topology and Percussion of P and B in Speech

**P** and **B** are bilabial stops that strike like drumheads. Their timing and airflow trace simple topologies:

1. **Closed surface**: both lips seal, forming a compact boundary that momentarily contains pressure.
2. **Pressure build**: airflow presses into the sealed chamber, turning the mouth into a tensioned membrane.
3. **Release**: the lips part; for **P** the burst rides only breath, for **B** the burst carries voice.
4. **After-ring**: vowels that follow resonate through the opened cavity, like sound traveling through a newly cut tunnel.

Reading aloud, you can feel these steps as spatial markers—closure, containment, break, and resonance. The letters become coordinates for navigating how speech drumming shapes the mouth.
