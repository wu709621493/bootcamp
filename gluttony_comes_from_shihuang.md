# Gluttony Comes from 食慌

"食慌" literally means a panic about food availability. The phrase points to the anxiety that emerges when someone grows up amid scarcity or instability. That fear of running out encourages hoarding, overeating, and other habits that look like gluttony, but at their core they come from insecurity rather than pure indulgence.

- **Survival programming:** When resources feel uncertain, the body and mind prioritize immediate consumption, reinforcing a reflex to eat whenever food is present.
- **Emotional compensation:** Meals become a quick way to soothe fear and stress, turning appetite into a coping mechanism.
- **Breaking the loop:** Building reliable routines, sharing meals in stable settings, and practicing mindful eating help replace panic-driven choices with deliberate nourishment.

Understanding gluttony through the lens of 食慌 reframes the behavior from a moral failing to a response to perceived scarcity. Addressing the underlying anxiety can transform the relationship with food into one rooted in safety and gratitude.
