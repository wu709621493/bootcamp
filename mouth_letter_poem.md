# The Mouth Between M and W

M closes, W opens—the mouth as hinge between them.

- **M** presses lips together, a moment of containment where words are held in the dark.
- **W** springs wide, a valley of sound, letting vowels spill like light.
- Between the two shapes is breath: the pause that chooses silence or speech.

Letters turn into gestures; the mouth learns their choreography.
