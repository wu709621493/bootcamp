# Peace manifesto

Peace is the practice of choosing patience over impulse and curiosity over certainty. It grows from daily habits more than grand gestures.

## Foundations
- **Steady breaths**: Simple breathing rituals calm the nervous system and interrupt spirals before they spread.
- **Listening before reply**: Letting silence finish its work reduces friction and reveals shared priorities.
- **Boundaries with kindness**: Clear limits stated warmly prevent resentment and invite mutual respect.
- **Repair loops**: When harm happens, name it, apologize, and propose concrete steps to make amends.

## Community cues
- Neighbors greet each other and stay curious about differences.
- Meetings end with aligned next steps instead of lingering tension.
- Disagreements are framed as joint problem-solving, not contests to win.
- Care is normalized: rest, water, and accessibility are treated as infrastructure, not extras.

Peace is not an endpoint; it is maintenance. Tending to it daily keeps the door open for trust, creativity, and shared courage.
