# 昼顔 (Hirugao)

* **Meaning:** The Japanese word "昼顔" (hirugao) literally means "daytime face" and commonly refers to the wild bindweed/field morning glory that opens during daylight hours.
* **Botanical note:** In Japan it is often associated with _Calystegia japonica_ (a perennial vine) and related species that bloom during the day, unlike the typical morning glories that close by noon.
* **Cultural note:** The term also evokes fleeting summer imagery and is used in literature and film titles to suggest brief, bright encounters.
