# Goal for the Next Bose-Einstein Condensate Experiment

## Objective
Establish a tunable, high-imbalance spin mixture of ultracold $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms that can be quenched across the ferromagnetic-to-polar transition within 50 ms while maintaining a peak phase-space density above 5. This goal focuses on revealing the early-time domain formation dynamics that emerge when the condensate is driven abruptly into the immiscible regime.

## Rationale
* **Spin-imbalanced mixtures** offer a clean platform for probing nonequilibrium symmetry breaking because the two components share nearly identical trapping potentials but can be coupled or decoupled via microwave dressing.
* **Fast quenches (\(< 50\,\mathrm{ms}\))** ensure that the system falls out of adiabatic following, which should seed topological defects whose density can be compared to Kibble-Zurek predictions.
* **High phase-space density** is required so that the condensate fraction remains above 70%, preventing thermal atoms from washing out the spin textures.

## Experimental Milestones
1. **Magnetically assisted loading**: Use a 3D MOT followed by gray molasses to reach sub-Doppler temperatures (<10 µK) before transfer into the hybrid magnetic-optical trap.
2. **Spin preparation**: Implement rapid adiabatic passage to populate \(|F=1,m_F=+1\rangle\) and \(|F=1,m_F=0\rangle\) states with a controllable imbalance ratio between 0.5 and 5.0 using calibrated RF sweeps.
3. **Interaction tuning**: Apply a homogeneous bias field near 9.1 G to exploit the narrow Feshbach resonance that modifies the inter-spin scattering length, enabling the immiscibility threshold to be reached within 5 ms.
4. **Quench protocol**: Program an AOM-based intensity ramp that drops the radial trap frequency by 35% while the bias field is shifted by +120 mG, driving the condensate across the phase boundary.
5. **Diagnostics**: Capture spin-resolved absorption images at 5, 15, 30, and 60 ms after the quench to quantify domain size, contrast, and defect density.

## Success Criteria
* Spin population imbalance stable within ±3% over 500 ms.
* Domain contrast >0.6 in at least 70% of shots at 30 ms after the quench.
* Extracted correlation length scaling exponent consistent with Kibble-Zurek predictions within experimental uncertainty (±0.1).
