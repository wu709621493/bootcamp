# Supporting an aging population in China

## Context
- China has one of the world's fastest-aging populations, with adults aged 60+ expected to exceed 30% of the population by 2035.
- Declining birth rates and rising longevity mean a shrinking working-age base must sustain a growing retiree population.

## Key challenges
- **Healthcare demand:** Rising prevalence of chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, diabetes) and long-term care needs.
- **Regional disparities:** Urban provinces have more geriatric clinicians and beds than rural areas, creating unequal access.
- **Care workforce shortages:** Insufficient supply of home-care aides, geriatric nurses, and rehabilitation specialists.
- **Financial sustainability:** Pressure on pension funds and social insurance systems as dependency ratios increase.

## Priority support strategies
- **Strengthen primary and preventive care**
  - Expand community health centers with chronic disease management programs (hypertension, diabetes, fall prevention).
  - Integrate electronic health records and telehealth to reach rural older adults.
- **Scale long-term care (LTC) options**
  - Subsidize home- and community-based services (HCBS) to delay institutionalization.
  - Develop day-care centers and respite services to support family caregivers.
  - Standardize quality metrics for LTC facilities (staff ratios, pressure injury rates, infection control).
- **Grow the geriatric workforce**
  - Create tuition incentives and fast-track credentials for geriatric nursing, rehabilitation, and home-care roles.
  - Offer rural service scholarships and housing stipends to improve distribution.
  - Mandate periodic geriatric-focused continuing education for clinicians.
- **Enhance financial protection**
  - Expand catastrophic health insurance coverage for high-cost chronic and LTC needs.
  - Pilot income-tested LTC insurance contributions in high-aging provinces before national rollout.
  - Introduce micro-pensions and flexible retirement ages for informal-sector workers.
- **Healthy aging environments**
  - Retrofit housing and public spaces for accessibility (ramps, elevators, grab bars, tactile paving).
  - Promote age-friendly transportation with fare discounts and priority seating compliance.
  - Invest in fall-risk mitigation: lighting, handrails, and community exercise programs.

## Implementation roadmap (near term)
1. **Identify high-need counties** using aging rate, chronic disease prevalence, and provider density to target pilots.
2. **Launch HCBS pilots** with bundled payments covering home nursing, rehab visits, and caregiver respite.
3. **Deploy telehealth hubs** in community clinics to connect rural patients to urban specialists.
4. **Train 10,000+ LTC aides** through subsidized 6–12 month programs with competency exams.
5. **Publish LTC quality dashboards** quarterly to benchmark facilities and incentivize improvements.

## Metrics to track
- Primary care: hypertension/diabetes control rates, 30-day readmissions for ≥65, vaccination coverage.
- LTC: staff-to-resident ratios, fall rates, pressure injuries, family satisfaction scores.
- Equity: urban–rural gaps in outpatient visits per capita and travel time to geriatric care.
- Sustainability: pension fund balance trends and LTC insurance claim ratios.

## Collaboration opportunities
- Public-private partnerships to build age-friendly housing and community centers.
- Industry engagement on assistive technologies (mobility aids, remote monitoring, smart home sensors).
- Academic–hospital networks to train geriatric specialists and share clinical protocols.
- NGO alignment for caregiver training, dementia support groups, and volunteer respite programs.
