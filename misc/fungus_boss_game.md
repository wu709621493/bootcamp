# Fungus Boss: Online Launch Notes

## Overview
Fungus Boss is now live as a fast-paced action puzzle game where players guide a colony of spores through maze-like caverns. The online version introduces shared leaderboards, weekly boss mutations, and co-op runs so multiple players can coordinate spore abilities in real time.

## Gameplay highlights
- **Dynamic boss phases:** The Fungus Boss cycles through toxin, armor, and swarm phases, forcing players to alternate between cleansing vents, breaking chitin plates, and defending their nutrient nodes.
- **Build variety:** Players unlock spore strains that specialize in healing, crowd control, or burst damage. Each run mixes strains to counter the current mutation set.
- **Environmental hazards:** Moving mycelial roots, nutrient floods, and bioluminescent traps reshape the arena mid-fight, rewarding positioning and timing.

## Online features
- **Matchmaking:** Quickplay pairs solo players with complementary strains, while Custom Rooms allow pre-made teams of four.
- **Progression:** Defeating the boss grants enzyme cores used to craft new spore strains or enhance cooldowns for existing abilities.
- **Leaderboards:** Seasonal ladders track fastest clears and lowest damage runs; weekly mutators rotate to keep strategies fresh.

## Getting started
1. Create an account or sign in with an existing profile.
2. Complete the tutorial to unlock the first trio of spore strains.
3. Queue for a Quickplay match or open a Custom Room for cooperative attempts.

## Tips for early clears
- Save cleanse abilities for the toxin phase to prevent ramping damage.
- Stagger crowd control when the swarm phase spawns so spores can focus fire the boss core.
- Watch arena lighting cues—blue pulses signal incoming nutrient floods that can both heal allies and power up enemy spores.

## Roadmap
Upcoming updates focus on raid-sized encounters, accessibility options for colorblind players, and a map editor for designing custom caverns.
