# Raindrop Admiration

Raindrops stitch fleeting silver threads across the afternoon, each bead a tiny lens that magnifies the world for a breath.

I admire the patience of their descent. They gather clouds, wind, and the slow brewing of oceans to arrive in this moment, tapping on rooftops like careful knuckles. Their rhythm is neither hurried nor idle; it is the cadence of the planet remembering how to cool its own skin.

When a drop finally meets the pavement, it bursts into a crown of mirrored fragments. The collision writes a brief psalm about surrender—how letting go reshapes the surface it touches. In puddles, the ripples propagate outward, sketching concentric invitations for the next droplet to join.

There is humility in their clarity. Raindrops do not demand a spotlight; they borrow it from streetlamps and lightning, share it with leaves and windowpanes, then release it back to the sky. Their transparency is their strength, revealing the colors beneath them rather than hiding what is already there.

Admiring raindrops is admiring the quiet choreography of renewal. Each drop carries the memory of rivers and the promise of fresh blossoms, reminding me that even the smallest fall can begin a watershed.
