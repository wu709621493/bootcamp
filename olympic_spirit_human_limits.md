# Olympic Spirit and Human Limits

The Olympic spirit celebrates the quest for excellence while honoring the boundaries of human endurance. It invites athletes to pursue their best performances with respect for body, mind, and fair competition, acknowledging that true greatness includes knowing when to rest, recover, and recognize personal limits. In this view, pushing forward and stepping back are both acts of courage that preserve the dignity of sport and the wellbeing of the people who make it possible.
