# Inclusive Infrastructure Roadmap for People Who Are Blind, Deaf, or Mute in China

## 1. Guiding Principles
- **Universal Design**: Build environments usable by all people without adaptation.
- **Standards Alignment**: Follow GB/T accessibility standards and WCAG 2.2 for digital products.
- **Regional Equity**: Prioritize rural and under-resourced areas with central subsidies.
- **Data-Driven Oversight**: Use accessibility audits and public dashboards to track compliance.

## 2. Physical Environment
- **Accessible Transit**: Mandate tactile paving continuity, audible/visual stop announcements, and low-floor buses; retrofit metro stations with platform-edge warnings and induction loops.
- **Wayfinding**: Deploy beacons plus Braille and embossed signage in transport hubs, hospitals, campuses, and government buildings; standardize signage height and contrast.
- **Safe Streets**: Install audible pedestrian signals, curb ramps with detectable warnings, and traffic-calming near schools for the deaf/blind.
- **Public Facilities**: Require hearing loops and captioning displays in service halls; reserve quiet rooms and visual alert systems in shelters and disaster-resilience sites.

## 3. Digital Accessibility
- **Government Services**: Enforce WCAG 2.2 AA across e-government portals, tax, health, and social security apps; add live/ASR captioning and sign-language video options.
- **Transportation & Mobility Apps**: Add screen-reader labels, high-contrast modes, haptic confirmations, and offline voice navigation; integrate taxi-hailing with human assistant hotlines.
- **Education Platforms**: Provide captioned lectures, sign-language interpretation, and tactile-friendly printable materials; ensure LMS compatibility with assistive tech used in Chinese schools.

## 4. Assistive Technologies & Support
- **National Subsidy Program**: Tiered vouchers for smart canes, Braille displays, hearing aids/cochlear processors, speech-generating devices, and assistive apps, with rural uplifts.
- **Repair & Calibration Network**: County-level service points co-located with community health centers; mobile vans for remote areas.
- **Open Data & APIs**: Publish accessible-mapping datasets (tactile paving, ramps, loops) with open APIs to spur private innovation.

## 5. Training & Workforce
- **Frontline Staff**: Mandatory annual accessibility training for transit operators, hospital registrars, police, and civil servants; include basic Chinese Sign Language modules.
- **Inclusive Education**: Fund teacher training colleges to offer assistive tech pedagogy and sign-language certification; expand university disability resource centers.
- **Employment Pathways**: Incentivize hiring of persons with disabilities via social-insurance credits; fund incubators for accessibility startups.

## 6. Emergency & Public Safety
- **Multi-Channel Alerts**: Push notifications with vibration patterns, on-screen flash, captions, and sign-language inserts for TV/streaming; outdoor sirens paired with visual strobes.
- **Evacuation Protocols**: Tactile floor plans, refuge areas with two-way communication, and staff drills that account for deaf/blind evacuees.

## 7. Governance & Measurement
- **Accessibility Scorecard**: City-level KPIs (accessible stops, loop coverage, app compliance, repair response time) published quarterly.
- **Participatory Audits**: Hire people with disabilities as testers for public works and digital services; publish remediation timelines.
- **Compliance & Incentives**: Link central funding and procurement eligibility to accessibility scores; offer fast-track approvals for compliant projects.

## 8. Pilot to Scale
- **Pilot Cities**: Start with one Tier-1, one provincial capital, and two county-level pilots representing varied geographies.
- **Evaluation**: 6- and 12-month audits covering user satisfaction, incident reduction, and service uptimes; iterate standards before national rollout.
