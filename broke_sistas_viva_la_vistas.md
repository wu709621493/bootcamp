# Broke Sistas, Viva la Vistas

## Logline
Two cash-strapped sisters convert a rundown desert motel into a free-spirited destination for travelers escaping the algorithm, turning their financial mess into a found-family revolution.

## Format
- **Genre:** Dramedy with light heist and hospitality caper elements
- **Length:** 30-minute episodes
- **Seasons:** Designed for 8-episode debut season with anthology-style guests
- **Tone:** Desert sunburn meets cozy-community optimism; a mix of witty banter, slow-burn character arcs, and oddball visitor-of-the-week stories

## Setting
A once-grand roadside motel outside El Paso, Texas, now peppered with DIY solar panels, hand-painted signage, and a retro lounge the sisters nickname “The Vista Room.” The borderland backdrop brings bilingual humor, cross-cultural stories, and constant run-ins with small-town politics.

## Main Characters
- **Lena Ortiz (32):** Former startup ops lead who burned out after a whistleblowing incident; loves whiteboards, hates bureaucracy. 
- **Maribel Ortiz (27):** Free-spirited street muralist with a gift for community organizing and guerilla marketing. 
- **Tío Rafa (58):** Their madrigal-singing, conspiracy-loving uncle who runs the motel’s maintenance crew like an improvised orchestra. 
- **Deputy Carla Ruiz (34):** Local sheriff’s deputy who alternates between enforcing regulations and bending them to help the sisters. 
- **Recurring Guests:** A rotating cast of misfits—runaway coders, retired luchadores, climate grad students, and grandmothers on lowrider pilgrimages—whose stories drive episode arcs.

## Season-One Arc
1. **Pilot:** The sisters inherit the collapsing motel and discover a mountain of unpaid fines; they host an underground art market to pay the water bill. 
2. **Episode 2:** They barter rooms for labor with a solar co-op, wiring the motel while dodging inspectors. 
3. **Episode 3:** A viral video brings a surge of guests and a cease-and-desist from a corporate hotel chain claiming the name “Vista.”
4. **Episode 4:** Maribel’s mural of borderland saints sparks controversy and free publicity; Lena reverse-engineers the booking site’s algorithm to redirect corporate traffic to their motel. 
5. **Episode 5:** A ransomware attack threatens their bookings; a teenage guest who is a hacker negotiates a creative counterstrike. 
6. **Episode 6:** Deputy Ruiz is torn between duty and friendship as the motel hosts an unsanctioned music festival. 
7. **Episode 7:** The sisters broker a truce between rival food trucks, turning the parking lot into a night market. 
8. **Finale:** With foreclosure looming, the community stages a “Vista-thon” livestream, exposing the corporate chain’s shady practices and securing the motel’s future.

## Themes
- Economic precarity meets ingenuity: building community equity when capital is scarce. 
- Sisterhood as both anchor and friction. 
- Who owns stories and spaces in the age of platforms.
- The borderland as a place of collaboration, not just conflict.

## Visual Style and Sound
- Warm, saturated desert palette; hand-painted typography for episode titles. 
- Needle drops mix cumbia, indie rock, and lo-fi beats. 
- Sound design leans into motel atmospherics: ice machines, cicadas, neon hums.

## Why It Works
- Combines hospitality hijinks with social commentary without preaching. 
- Episodic guest stories keep plots fresh while the sisterly arc provides heart. 
- The setting allows bilingual jokes and cross-border cultural crossover. 
- Budget-friendly: single primary location with stylized, practical set dressing.
