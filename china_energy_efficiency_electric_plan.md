# Efficiency-Based Electric Plan for China

## Objectives and Targets
- **Primary goal:** Maximize end-use efficiency to curb demand growth while supporting electrification and decarbonization.
- **2030 targets:**
  - Reduce electricity intensity (kWh per unit GDP) by 25% versus 2020 baseline.
  - Cap peak grid load growth to <2% annually through efficiency and demand response (DR).
  - Achieve 70% smart-meter penetration and 40% time-of-use (TOU) tariff enrollment.
- **2035 vision:** Demand growth fully decoupled from GDP; >50% of consumption on TOU/real-time pricing and >80% buildings meeting near-zero-energy standards.

## Demand-Side Efficiency
- **Industry (≈60% of consumption):**
  - Mandate best-available technology (BAT) for motors, drives, compressors, and furnaces with accelerated retirement of Tier 3/4 equipment.
  - Expand energy performance contracting for steel, cement, and chemicals; link subsidies to verified kWh savings via digital MRV (measurement, reporting, verification).
  - Deploy waste-heat-to-power and heat-pump electrification in refining and chemicals; target 20% process heat below 200°C shifted to electric heat pumps by 2030.
- **Buildings:**
  - Tighten codes to near-zero-energy for coastal Tier-1/2 cities by 2027 and nationwide by 2030.
  - Mass retrofit program (insulation, windows, HVAC) financed via green bonds; prioritize public buildings and social housing.
  - Accelerate heat-pump water heaters and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems; require smart thermostats with open standards.
- **Transport:**
  - Expand rail freight share and urban transit; pair EV adoption with high-efficiency charging (bidirectional where feasible).
  - Mandate efficiency labels for chargers and enforce minimum conversion efficiency.

## Demand Response and Flexibility
- Roll out dynamic tariffs: TOU nationwide, critical peak pricing in congested provinces, and optional real-time pricing for large users.
- Create provincial DR markets with standardized baselines; compensate both capacity (kW) and energy (kWh) reductions.
- Encourage behind-the-meter storage, cold-warehouse precooling, and industrial load shifting with automated dispatch via aggregators.

## Supply-Side Efficiency and Clean Energy Integration
- Prioritize high-capacity-factor renewables (onshore/offshore wind, utility-scale solar with tracking) co-located with storage to minimize curtailment.
- Retrofit existing coal with high-efficiency ultra-supercritical units and strict minimum-load requirements; retire subcritical units on a published timeline.
- Deploy grid-scale storage (lithium, flow batteries, pumped hydro) to firm variable renewables and provide frequency regulation.
- Promote combined heat and power (CHP) in district energy systems with heat storage to reduce winter peaks.

## Grid Modernization
- **Transmission:** Accelerate ultra-high-voltage (UHV) corridors from renewable bases to load centers; include dynamic line rating and wide-area monitoring systems.
- **Distribution:** Upgrade feeders for bidirectional flows, advanced distribution management systems (ADMS), and voltage/VAR optimization to cut technical losses.
- **Digitalization:** Universal AMI, substation automation, and synchrophasors for congestion management; open data interfaces for third-party services.

## Market and Policy Instruments
- Establish efficiency resource standards for utilities, requiring verified annual kWh savings and peak reduction targets.
- Implement green certificates for efficiency (negawatts) tradable alongside renewable energy certificates.
- Align capacity markets to value flexible, efficient resources (DR, storage, efficient CHP) with performance-based penalties.
- Provide tax incentives and accelerated depreciation for high-efficiency equipment and smart controls.

## Financing and Implementation
- Use sovereign green bonds and local government special-purpose vehicles to fund retrofits and grid upgrades; attract private capital via blended finance.
- Launch performance-based rebates for SMEs and households tied to measured savings; include low-interest loans through policy banks.
- Establish a national efficiency data platform for benchmarking and MRV, enabling AI-driven audits and project targeting.

## Key Metrics and Timeline
- **2025:** 30% TOU enrollment; 10 GW DR capacity; 50% smart meters; pilot negawatt certificates.
- **2030:** 25% electricity intensity reduction; 40% TOU enrollment; 30 GW DR; majority of coal fleet at ultra-supercritical efficiency.
- **2035:** Demand growth decoupled from GDP; >50% TOU/real-time pricing; >80% near-zero-energy buildings; mature DR and storage markets enabling >60% renewable share without reliability loss.
