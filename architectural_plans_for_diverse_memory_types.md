# Architectural Plans for People with Diverse Memory Types

## Design principles
- **Predictable layouts:** Use consistent floorplate logic, mirrored stacking, and repeated room modules to reduce cognitive load.
- **Redundant cues:** Combine visual, tactile, and auditory signals (color bands, textures, soft chimes) to aid recall and orientation.
- **Choice with guardrails:** Offer multiple routes and seating nooks while keeping sightlines open to destinations and staff.
- **Gradual stimuli:** Transition lighting, acoustics, and temperature between zones to help people anticipate change.
- **Personalizable micro-environments:** Allow residents to anchor memory with photos, scent diffusers, and preferred lighting scenes.

## Site and campus planning
- Cluster buildings around a central courtyard or looped promenade to create a memorable anchor and safe circulation.
- Locate primary entries along the most direct transit path; use distinct façade materials per building for recognition.
- Provide sheltered drop-off zones with benches and storage for mobility aids to reduce stressful transitions.

## Wayfinding and signage
- Establish a hierarchy of cues: district colors at the campus level, pattern/texture bands per wing, pictograms for rooms.
- Use high-contrast, large-type signage at consistent heights; pair text with arrows and landmarks (art, plants, murals).
- Integrate tactile floor strips and handrail markers that change texture near decision points and elevators.
- Add beacon lighting (soft LED edges) at destinations such as restrooms, kitchens, and exits.

## Circulation strategy
- Favor looped corridors over dead-ends; provide frequent “pause points” with seating and daylight to reduce anxiety.
- Separate quiet and active routes; buffer noisy areas with acoustic baffles, bookshelves, or planted partitions.
- Use transparent doors or sidelights for shared rooms so occupants can preview activities without committing.

## Room and unit design
- **Entrances:** Recessed entries with small shelves and hooks for personal objects that cue memory of routines.
- **Bathrooms:** Contrasting fixtures, anti-scald valves, lever handles, and motion-activated night lighting.
- **Bedrooms:** Dimmable, tunable white lighting; blackout options for sleep hygiene; built-in display niches for mementos.
- **Kitchens:** Induction cooktops, auto-shutoff appliances, transparent cabinets, and labeled drawers.
- **Shared spaces:** Flexible furniture on casters, writable walls for reminders, and display rails for rotating memory boards.

## Lighting and acoustics
- Provide circadian lighting schedules: brighter, cooler mornings; warmer, dimmer evenings with gradual transitions.
- Avoid glare by using matte finishes, indirect uplighting, and solar control at large glazing.
- Maintain background noise under 45 dBA in quiet zones; apply soft surfaces, acoustic ceiling tiles, and door seals.

## Materials and color
- Use durable, non-patterned flooring with subtle color shifts to denote zones without resembling depth changes.
- Choose handrail and door hardware colors that contrast with walls; avoid mirror-like finishes that can confuse orientation.
- Incorporate familiar, nature-inspired materials (wood, stone, plants) to anchor long-term memory and comfort.

## Technology and digital supports
- Deploy digital door plaques with names, photos, and color bands that match the wing identity.
- Install gentle wayfinding beacons paired with mobile or wearable prompts, configurable by caregiver consent.
- Provide shared screens for daily schedules, menus, and transit info using clear icons and plain language.
- Use discreet sensors for fall detection and wandering alerts, with privacy-respecting data policies posted clearly.

## Safety and risk reduction
- Specify anti-slip surfaces, rounded corners, and low-threshold transitions between flooring types.
- Position grab bars and continuous handrails along primary routes; integrate low-level night lighting for paths to restrooms.
- Offer secure but inviting outdoor loops with shaded seating, hydration points, and clear boundaries.

## Programming and operations alignment
- Program spaces for short, repeatable routines: morning sunrooms, mid-day music areas, evening quiet lounges.
- Provide staff touchdown points at sightline intersections to enable unobtrusive support.
- Maintain consistent furniture layouts and cleaning schedules; announce changes via posters and digital boards ahead of time.

## Emergency planning
- Mark areas of refuge with both signage and distinctive lighting; ensure two accessible egress routes per wing.
- Use audible alerts with voice instructions; pair with color-changing corridor lighting to direct flow.
- Place emergency information cards at unit entries and staff stations with pictorial instructions.

## Evaluation and feedback
- Conduct post-occupancy evaluations on orientation success, fall incidents, and stress indicators.
- Gather feedback from residents, caregivers, and staff; adjust cues, lighting schedules, and furniture layouts iteratively.
