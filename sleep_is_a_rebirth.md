# Sleep Is A Rebirth

Sleep is the quiet ceremony where yesterday is allowed to finish.
Each breath slows, and the mind loosens its grip on the lists, alarms, and corridors of unfinished thought.
In the dark, memory reweaves itself and the body rehearses its own repair.

Waking is therefore not a simple continuation but a restart.
After rest, colors feel sharper because the eyes have chosen to open again, and choices feel lighter because the night dissolved their rust.
The problems that survive the night emerge clarified; the ones that fade were never worth carrying.

If rebirth is imagined as beginning anew with what we choose to keep, then sleep grants that privilege daily.
It is a democratic rite of renewal available to anyone with a place to lie down, a pause in noise, and a willingness to let go.
