# A Flower is a Running Vector That Flows

A single petal arcs forward like an arrow, carrying scent and color as though they were coordinates. The stem keeps time as a baseline, measuring the distance between soil and sunlight while the blossom advances along its own axis.

When the wind nudges the bloom, the flower traces a curve, solving for balance between gravity and grace. Each sway is a calculation with real roots: stability at the base, acceleration in the reach, and a constant of softness that refuses to vanish.

Together the petals form a field, flowing through air like data through a stream. They map the neighborhood of buzzing pollinators and lingering rain, proving that motion can be gentle, and that vectors can carry beauty as easily as numbers.
